# SocialTap
## Project Description
For our project, we decided to develop an application that allows users to share their social media/professional platforms using an NFC sticker on the back of their phone (or anywhere desired; laptop, wallet, water bottle, etc.). When tapped, the NFC sticker should redirect the person tapping it to a profile configured by the end user. The user will have a choice of what social media and professional platforms they want to display on their page, and they will have the ability to add a photograph and a bio as well through a customization panel.
