### User stories

1.  As a user, I want to be able to share my social media accounts simply by having a sticker, so that it is easier and faster to connect with people.
2.  As an end user, I want to be able to select from the following social platforms to display them on my page: Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Snapchat, Resume, Personal Website, Cover Letter, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Phone, Email, etc. to allow me to connect with as many people as possible across all social platforms.
3. As an end user, I want to be able to upload my own profile picture and bio to allow a more personal connection when networking with others.
4. As an end user, I was to be able to login to the platform from a choice of authentication methods to allow me to choose the option that works best with my pre-existing authentication patterns.
5. As a user, I want to be able to share my Linkedin with others and network my information for possible employment opportunities.

### Issues Planned to Address

1. Storing the user information they want to display.
2. Create a SQL database with all the users' information.
3. Define handler functions for http requests.
4. Create a mocker user profile in Angular
5. 

#### Completed
We were able to create a MySQL database and create a server connection so that the data from the requests gets written in our tables. We tested the functionality using Postman. With that said, the handler functions turn out to work well also. Now we have to extend the functionality of our database and have more data stored for each user.

#### Not Completed
We weren't able to store every information the user wants to display, we still have to figure out a way to store the social media accounts and link them to their actual social media page.
