## Sprint 2

### Work Completed 
  - For the backend portion of our project, We integerated authentication and authorization by implementing Auth0. Auth0 adds authentication
    to our program and allows our team to avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize 
    users. Our users should be able to log in with their social accounts (such as Facebook or Google). You want to retrieve the user's profile 
    after the login so you can customize the UI and apply your authorization policies.
